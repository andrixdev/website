# Setup
* Install npm (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* Open your favourite Command Line Interface. *git bash*, the CLI that comes with Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads), is an option I would recommend
* Optional: you may want to switch to the *dev* branch to get the latest commits, in the CLI run **git checkout dev**
* Run **npm install** to import all necessary packages
* Run **npm start** to boot a local server on port 8080
* Open your favorite browser and navigate to **127.0.0.1:8080** or **localhost:8080**
* Enjoy
